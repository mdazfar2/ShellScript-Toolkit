### I'll always suggest to read the documentation of the product as they are official creators and try to make and explain the things
### in the easiest way possible so i'm providing the resources below for what i've gone through while learning docker and kubernetes

### I don't want to talk about the architecture of K8's as it will be a lot to consume at once.
### but i do provide my docker blog [here](https://nvrc.hashnode.dev/getting-started-with-docker-beginners-guide) for getting started with basics of docker.

### If you want to learn more about K8's and as i prefer, Documentation is the best option. Again there are lot of youtube channels for this one. It's your choice.
